# City Resource & Infrastructure Management Platform

## Problem Statement

Urban city infrastructure management involves multiple departments, approval levels, and resource constraints, making planning, execution, and monitoring of infrastructure projects complex and time-consuming. Current processes rely heavily on manual coordination, documentation, and delayed reporting, which leads to inefficient resource utilization, lack of transparency in budget allocation, delayed project execution, and limited accountability across departments. There is a need for a centralized digital platform that enables city authorities to plan, monitor, approve, execute, and validate infrastructure projects efficiently while ensuring proper utilization of public funds and improved coordination between administrative, departmental, and field-level stakeholders.
